# 🌟 Luma - Advanced AI Development DSL

🚀 **Luma** is a high-performance Domain-Specific Language (DSL) crafted by [Z2ZATL](https://github.com/Z2ZATL) for building and deploying advanced AI solutions. Built with Rust, Luma offers an extensible framework for managing AI pipelines, from data preprocessing to model deployment, with zero-error precision and community-driven plugins. 🎉

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 🦀: Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Git** 📦: Install from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Z2ZATL/Luma.git
   cd Luma
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run tests to verify:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

### Usage Example

Create a file `example.luma` with the following content:

```luma
load dataset "iris.csv" as iris lazy=True
create model neural_network
train epochs=10 batch_size=32 learning_rate=0.01
evaluate metrics="accuracy,precision"
save model "iris_model.luma"
```

Run it with Luma:
```bash
cargo run -- example.luma
```

## 🔌 Plugins

Luma supports extensibility via plugins. Available community plugins include:

- **Multimodal Support** 📝🖼️: Handle text and image data.
- **Custom NLP Module** 💬: Tokenization and sentiment analysis.
- **Image Processing** 🖼️: Resize and grayscale conversion.

### Using Plugins

1. Register a plugin:
   ```c
   luma_register_plugin(registry, "multi_modal");
   ```
2. Execute a plugin command:
   ```c
   luma_execute_plugin(registry, "multi_modal", "add_text", ["1", "hello", "world"], 3);
   ```

See `plugins/community/` for more details.
