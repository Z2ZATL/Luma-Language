## üí° Get Started

Luma simplifies the entire AI workflow. Here‚Äôs a taste of its intuitive DSL:

```luma
// Load your dataset
load dataset "iris.csv" as iris_data

// Preprocess your data
preprocess iris_data with normalize

// Split into training and testing sets
split iris_data into train_data test_data with ratio=0.8

// Create your neural network model
create model logistic_regression {
    layer Dense neurons=10 activation=ReLU
    layer Dense neurons=3 activation=Softmax
}

// Train your model
train model logistic_regression on train_data with epochs=50 batch_size=32 learning_rate=0.01

// Evaluate performance
evaluate model logistic_regression on test_data

// Visualize results
visualize model logistic_regression performance

// Save your trained model
save model logistic_regression to "my_iris_model.json"
```
